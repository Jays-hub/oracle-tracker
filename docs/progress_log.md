# Progress Log

The running record of **product** work, newest first. Each entry is dated and tagged: `[built]` when a
unit is handed off to review, `[reviewed]` / `[fixed]` as the review closes, `[decided]` for a
consequential choice. `/session-start` reads the top of this file to orient; keep entries terse and
name the artifacts + the verified test count so the drift check has something real to compare against.

(Workflow/tooling changes go in `docs/agentic_workflow/current_state.md`, not here.)

## 2026-08-03 — Project initialized from agentic-starter

[decided] Adopted the build→review loop: `/session-start` to orient, `/build` to build one unit,
`/review` for a cold-context adversarial review, `/ship` to open the PR.

[decided] Scoped the product: **restaurant-map** is a personal, standalone, local-first visiting
tracker for restaurant-development work — pins for restaurants I've visited, color-coded by lead
strength (strong = green / weak = amber / failed = red), with free-form notes per pin. Stack: React +
Vite + TypeScript + Leaflet over OSM tiles, `localStorage` persistence, Vitest + ESLint/`tsc`. No
backend/DB/API (single-user, local-first). Product DONE-WHEN lives in `CLAUDE.md` #3.

Next: build the first unit — **"Map + colored pins"**: scaffold the Vite app, render the Leaflet map,
add-restaurant (name + click-to-place), lead-strength → pin color, persist across reload. Notes +
editing are a later unit.
