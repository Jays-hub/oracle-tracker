# Progress Log

The running record of **product** work, newest first. Each entry is dated and tagged: `[built]` when a
unit is handed off to review, `[reviewed]` / `[fixed]` as the review closes, `[decided]` for a
consequential choice. `/session-start` reads the top of this file to orient; keep entries terse and
name the artifacts + the verified test count so the drift check has something real to compare against.

(Workflow/tooling changes go in `docs/agentic_workflow/current_state.md`, not here.)

## <<DATE>> — Project initialized from agentic-starter

[decided] Adopted the build→review loop: `/session-start` to orient, `/build` to build one unit,
`/review` for a cold-context adversarial review, `/ship` to open the PR. Next: fill the `CLAUDE.md`
placeholders, then build the first unit.
